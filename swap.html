<h1>Hardware Swap</h1>

<p>Over the past few months, during my learning tests, I've accumulated some devices that I no longer use or never used. I created this page to facilitate the exchange of these devices for others that interest me. The main idea is that the exchanges are made in person, opening the possibility to share experiences in a chat.</p>

<p>So if you are interested in any of the devices listed below and you are in the Greater Boston area please send your offer using the link at the end of each device page. If I find the offer good we can arrange a place to meet and finalize the deal.</p>

<br />

<h2>Device List</h2>

<ul class="post-list">
  {% for swap in site.swaps %}
    <li class="post-container">
      <a href="{{ swap.url }}" class="swap-link">
        <img src="../assets/img/swap/thumb/{{ swap.item }}/thumb.png" width="50" height="50">
      </a>
      <p>
        <a href="{{ swap.url }}">
          {{ swap.name }}
        </a>
      </p>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
