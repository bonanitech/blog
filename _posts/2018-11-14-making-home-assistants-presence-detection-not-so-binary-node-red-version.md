A reader made me aware of an issue in the sequence when using the `zone` integration in Home Assistant. The tracked person's state would change to "Just Left" again when entering or exiting a zone.

Here's the sequence with a fix for this issue.

Thank you, [CamelY0](https://disqus.com/by/camely0/), for finding, reporting, and helping to fix the issue.

Here's the most recent version of the sequence. Now I'm using the `person` integration to track people. If you're using `device_tracker`, remember to change the first and third nodes according to your needs.

If you use `node-red-contrib-home-assistant-websocket` (default in Node-RED Community Hass.io Add-on), the sequence can be even smaller.

Since its [version 0.3.0](https://github.com/zachowj/node-red-contrib-home-assistant-websocket/releases/tag/v0.3.0):

> Call Service and Fire Event nodes are now able to render mustache templates in the data property.

This means that we can remove almost all of the template nodes used in the original sequence and move their content to the call service nodes right after them.

**--- ORIGINAL POST ---**
{: style="color:gray; font-size: 80%; text-align: center;"}

My special thanks to Phil Hawthorne for letting me use the title of his post here.

In early 2018 I found Phil's excellent blog post "[Making Home Assistantâ€™s Presence Detection not so Binary](https://philhawthorne.com/making-home-assistants-presence-detection-not-so-binary/)" and began using the setup suggested by him almost immediately.

A few months later I started migrating my automations to Node-RED and posted the initial results in the [comments section](https://philhawthorne.com/making-home-assistants-presence-detection-not-so-binary/#comment-3945751887) of Phil's post.

This works great, but the caveat is that you have to have one sequence for each device tracked.

I started looking for a way to have only one sequence for all the tracked devices, after some time (with some hits and many, many misses) this is what I came out with.

<br />

![Template Sequence]({{ "/assets/img/2018-11-14-template_sequence.png" | absolute_url }})

The JSON code of this sequence is available <a href="/download/making-home-assistants-presence-detection-not-so-binary-node-red-version-v1.json" download target="_blank">here</a>.

<br />

Now all I needed was to set up an `input_select` with the same name of a `device_tracker` in Home Assistant.

In `known_devices.yaml`:

<br />

```yaml
homer:
  hide_if_away: false
  icon:
  mac: 00:00:00:00:00:00
  name: Homer
  picture: /local/homer.png
  track: true
```

<br />

In `configuration.yaml`:

<br />

```yaml
input_select:
  homer:
    options:
      - Home
      - Just Arrived
      - Just Left
      - Away
      - Extended Away
```

<br />

And in Node-RED an `events: state` node that should be connected to the change node in the beginning of the sequence.

<br />

![Homer]({{ "/assets/img/2018-11-14-homer_node.png" | absolute_url }})

<br />

This must be repeated for each person being tracked, just replacing the names where needed.

For example:

<br />

```yaml
marge:
  hide_if_away: false
  icon:
  mac: 11:11:11:11:11:11
  name: Marge
  picture: /local/marge.png
  track: true
```

<br />

```yaml
input_select:
  marge:
    options:
      - Home
      - Just Arrived
      - Just Left
      - Away
      - Extended Away
```

<br />

![Marge]({{ "/assets/img/2018-11-14-marge_node.png" | absolute_url }})

<br />

The final result should be something like this:

<br />

![Node-RED]({{ "/assets/img/2018-11-14-node-red.png" | absolute_url }})

<br />

![Home Assistant]({{ "/assets/img/2018-11-14-home-assistant.png" | absolute_url }})
